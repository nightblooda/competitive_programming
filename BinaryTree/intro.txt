A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at same level.

A full binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which all nodes have either zero or two child nodes

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
